# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a credit card customer will churn (i.e., stop using the service). It involves data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model building using popular Python libraries. The Random Forest classifier achieves **92% accuracy** in identifying at-risk customers.



## Objectives
- Understand the factors that influence customer churn in the credit card industry
- Perform thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build machine learning models to classify churned vs. retained customers
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
- Derive actionable insights to help reduce customer attrition

## Files
- `notebooks/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with code and analysis
- `data/BankChurners.csv` – Dataset used for training and evaluation

## How to Run
You can run the notebook in:
- **Google Colab** – Recommended, no setup needed
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Install dependencies with:
`pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

Then open the .ipynb notebook and run all cells.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)
